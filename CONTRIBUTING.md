# Contributing to this Project

Welcome to the team! To keep our `master` branch stable, we follow a strict review process.

## The Workflow
1. **Branch:** Never work directly on `master`. Create a new branch:
   `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. **Commit:** Keep your commit messages clear and descriptive.
3. **Push:** Push your branch to GitHub:
   `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
4. **Pull Request (PR):** Open a PR from your branch to `master`.

## Approval Process

* **Sole Approver:** @deepikadhar-bm (Repository Owner)

* All code must be reviewed and approved before it can be merged.
* Please ensure all tests pass before requesting a review.

## Direct Pushes
Direct pushes to `master` are disabled by branch protection rules. If you try to push to `master`, Git will reject it.
